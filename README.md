# Rain-Water-Storage-2D-Problem
The main intention of the problem is that, if we pour water from space on any object, how much of water does the object store? The object is a cuboid where it is constructed using blocks. Input is given in a 2*2 matrix format. ex[[3,3,3],[3,1,3],[3,3,3]]. Here in the given example, If I pour water from space, 2 units of water gonna store in middle block. After that, water gonna leak. So, the total storage gonna be 2. If the input matrix has 0 in middle, then there won't be any water storage since if we pour water from space, water gonna leak from middle since there's no block.
